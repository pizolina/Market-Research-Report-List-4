<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Fiber Optic Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Mode Fiber</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distributed fiber optic temperature sensors are available in two market types: Multi-mode fiber and Single-mode fiber. Multi-mode fiber sensors use a larger core size, allowing multiple modes of light to travel through the fiber. This makes them better suited for shorter distances and applications where cost is a factor. On the other hand, single-mode fiber sensors have a smaller core size, enabling a single mode of light to travel through the fiber. This makes them ideal for longer distances and applications requiring high accuracy.</p></p>
