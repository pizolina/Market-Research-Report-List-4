<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spring Type Safety Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Non-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spring Type Safety Valves are commonly divided into two market types: Closed Type and Non-closed Type. Closed Type safety valves are designed to remain closed until the pressure reaches a specific set point, at which point they open to release excess pressure. On the other hand, Non-closed Type safety valves are always open, allowing a continuous flow of fluid until the pressure exceeds the set point, causing the valve to close. Both types are essential for maintaining pressure and preventing potential hazards in various industrial applications.</p></p>
