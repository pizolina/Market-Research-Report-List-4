<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-phase Rectifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half-wave Rectification</li><li>Full-wave Rectification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Half-wave rectification is a type of three-phase rectifier where only half of the incoming alternating current wave is converted to direct current. This type of rectification is simpler and less expensive than full-wave rectification, but it results in more ripple in the output voltage. Full-wave rectification, on the other hand, converts the entire incoming wave into direct current, resulting in a smoother output voltage with less ripple. This type of rectification is more efficient but also more complex and costly to implement.</p></p>
