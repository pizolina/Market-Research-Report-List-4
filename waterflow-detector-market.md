<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waterflow Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screw Type</li><li>Saddle Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Waterflow detectors are devices used in fire protection systems to monitor the flow of water in sprinkler systems. There are two main types of waterflow detectors: screw type and saddle type. Screw type detectors are installed directly into the pipe using threaded connections, while saddle type detectors are clamped onto the outside of the pipe. Both types are designed to detect abnormal water flow rates, which can indicate a fire or other emergency situation, and trigger the activation of the sprinkler system for rapid response.</p></p>
