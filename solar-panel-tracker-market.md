<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Panel Tracker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-axis Tracker</li><li>Dual-axis Tracker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar Panel Tracker market types include single-axis trackers and dual-axis trackers. Single-axis trackers tilt along one axis to follow the sun's path throughout the day, maximizing sunlight exposure. Dual-axis trackers can tilt along both vertical and horizontal axes, further optimizing sunlight capture. Single-axis trackers are more common due to lower costs and simpler design, while dual-axis trackers offer increased efficiency but at a higher price point. Both types of trackers play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of solar panels and increasing energy output.</p></p>
