<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-stage Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single-stage magnetic pump market can be categorized into two main types based on the shaft design: stationary shaft and rotating shaft. In stationary shaft pumps, the shaft remains fixed in place while the impeller rotates around it. On the other hand, rotating shaft pumps have the shaft connected to the impeller, causing both to spin together. Each type offers unique advantages and is suited for different applications based on factors such as reliability, efficiency, and maintenance requirements.</p></p>
