<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive SMD Fuses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Body (Chip) Fuses</li><li>Wire-in-Air Fuses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive SMD fuses come in two main types: solid body (chip) fuses and wire-in-air fuses. Solid body fuses are compact and provide protection against overcurrent in a small footprint. They are suitable for high-density circuit boards. Wire-in-air fuses use a wire element within a ceramic or glass tube to protect against overcurrent. They are commonly used in automotive applications where space is limited and high current protection is required. Both types of fuses play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and reliability of automotive electrical systems.</p></p>
