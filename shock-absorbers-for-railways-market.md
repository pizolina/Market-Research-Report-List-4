<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shock Absorbers for Railways Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axle Box Shock Absorber</li><li>Pillow Damper (Central Damper)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shock absorbers for railways are essential components that help minimize vibrations and impacts caused by irregularities on the tracks. Two common types are axle box shock absorbers, which are mounted on the wheel axle to absorb vertical shocks, and pillow dampers (central dampers), which are placed between the car body and bogie to absorb lateral forces. These shock absorbers ensure a smoother and more comfortable ride for passengers while also reducing wear and tear on the railway infrastructure.</p></p>
