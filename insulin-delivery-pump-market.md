<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Delivery Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-loop</li><li>Close-loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insulin delivery pumps come in two main types: open-loop and closed-loop systems. Open-loop pumps deliver a continuous supply of insulin based on programmed settings without considering real-time blood glucose levels. Closed-loop systems, also known as automated insulin delivery systems, continuously monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin delivery accordingly to maintain optimal blood sugar levels. Closed-loop systems offer more precise and personalized insulin delivery, while open-loop systems rely on pre-set settings. Both types play a crucial role in managing diabetes effectively.</p></p>
