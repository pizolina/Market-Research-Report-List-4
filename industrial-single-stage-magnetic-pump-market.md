<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Single-stage Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial single-stage magnetic pump market can be categorized into two types based on the shaft design: stationary shaft and rotating shaft. In stationary shaft pumps, the shaft remains fixed while the impeller rotates around it, providing stability and durability. On the other hand, rotating shaft pumps have a shaft that spins along with the impeller, increasing efficiency and reducing wear and tear. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific application and requirements of the industrial process.</p></p>
