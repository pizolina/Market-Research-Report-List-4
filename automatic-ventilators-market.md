<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilation refers to a type of automatic ventilator that delivers air into the lungs at a higher pressure than atmospheric pressure, helping to inflate the lungs and improve oxygenation. This mode of ventilation is commonly used in critical care settings to support patients with respiratory failure. On the other hand, Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilation involves creating a vacuum around the chest to expand the lungs and allow air to enter. This type of ventilation is less commonly used compared to positive pressure ventilation.</p></p>
