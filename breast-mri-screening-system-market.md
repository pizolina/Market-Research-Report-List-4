<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breast MRI Screening System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Systems</li><li>Open Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breast MRI screening systems are categorized into two types based on their design - closed systems and open systems. Closed systems are traditional MRI machines that fully enclose the patient during the scan, providing high-quality images but causing potential discomfort for claustrophobic patients. On the other hand, open systems are designed to be more open and less confining, offering a more comfortable experience for patients. Both types of systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, catering to the diverse needs of patients undergoing breast MRI screening.</p></p>
