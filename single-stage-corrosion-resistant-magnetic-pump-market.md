<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-stage Corrosion-resistant Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-stage corrosion-resistant magnetic pumps are available in two types: Stationary Shaft and Rotating Shaft. </p><p>In the Stationary Shaft design, the impeller is fixed to the pump housing while the magnetic coupling rotates around the stationary shaft. This design minimizes the risk of leaks and contamination. </p><p>In the Rotating Shaft design, the impeller is attached to the magnetic coupling, which rotates on a stationary shaft. This design allows for a more compact pump size and easier maintenance access. Both types offer excellent corrosion resistance for handling corrosive fluids.</p></p>
