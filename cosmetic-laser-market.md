<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cosmetic Laser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ablative</li><li>Non-Ablative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cosmetic laser market is divided into two main types: ablative and non-ablative. Ablative lasers work by removing outer layers of skin, stimulating collagen production and improving skin texture. They are often used for treating deep wrinkles, scars, and sun damage. Non-ablative lasers, on the other hand, target the underlying layers of skin without damaging the outer layer. They are typically used for improving skin tone, reducing fine lines, and promoting collagen production. Both types of lasers have their own benefits and are chosen based on the specific cosmetic concerns of the patient.</p></p>
