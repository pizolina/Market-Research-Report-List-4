<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piston Rod Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Cylinders</li><li>Double-Acting Cylinders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-acting cylinders in the piston rod cylinder market utilize air pressure to move the piston in one direction, with a spring or gravity returning it to its original position. These cylinders are commonly used in applications where the load is moved in one direction only. On the other hand, double-acting cylinders can move the piston in both directions, using air pressure to extend and retract the piston. These cylinders are advantageous in applications where precise control over movement is required.</p></p>
