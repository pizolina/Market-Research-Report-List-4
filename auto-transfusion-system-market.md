<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Transfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Autotransfusion Systems</li><li>Discontinuous Autotransfusion Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous autotransfusion systems continuously collect and process blood from the surgical site, filtering it and returning it to the patient. This type of system is commonly used in longer surgical procedures where significant blood loss is expected. Discontinuous autotransfusion systems collect and process blood in batches, making them suitable for shorter procedures with less anticipated blood loss. Both types of autotransfusion systems help reduce the need for donor blood transfusions, minimize the risk of infection, and improve patient outcomes during surgery.</p></p>
