<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Contact Hall Effect Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Unipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact Hall effect sensors can be categorized into two main types based on their output signals: bipolar and unipolar. Bipolar Hall effect sensors provide a positive voltage output when a south pole magnetic field is detected and a negative voltage output when a north pole magnetic field is detected. On the other hand, unipolar Hall effect sensors only respond to one polarity of magnetic field, typically detecting the presence of a south pole and providing a positive voltage output, while ignoring the presence of a north pole.</p></p>
