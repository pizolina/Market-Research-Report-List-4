<p><h1>Tenodesis Screw Market Size, Market Share and Global Market Analysis Report, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Tenodesis Screw Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A tenodesis screw is a medical device used in orthopedic surgeries to reattach tendons to bones. It is commonly used in procedures such as repair of rotator cuff tears, biceps tenodesis, and reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The screw is inserted into the bone to secure the tendon in place, allowing for proper healing and function.</p><p>The global tenodesis screw market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of sports-related injuries and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as the rising geriatric population. Additionally, advancements in surgical techniques and materials used in tenodesis screws are driving market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the tenodesis screw market is the development of biodegradable screws that are absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove the screw. This technology is expected to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs in the long term. Another trend is the increasing adoption of minimally invasive procedures, which offer faster recovery times and less scarring for patients undergoing tenodesis surgeries. These trends are likely to contribute to the continued growth of the tenodesis screw market in the coming years.</p></p>
