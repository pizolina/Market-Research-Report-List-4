<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-Way Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Bore</li><li>Reduced Bore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Two-way valve market types refer to the size of the valve opening. Full bore valves have a valve opening that is the same size as the pipeline, allowing for maximum flow capacity. Reduced bore valves have a smaller valve opening than the pipeline, which reduces flow capacity but can be more cost-effective. Full bore valves are typically used in applications where maximum flow is required, while reduced bore valves are used when cost considerations are important and slightly reduced flow capacity is acceptable.</p></p>
