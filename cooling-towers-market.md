<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cooling Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit Cooling Towers</li><li>Closed-Circuit Cooling Towers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cooling Towers Market Types include Open-Circuit and Closed-Circuit Cooling Towers. Open-Circuit Cooling Towers involve the process of water being cooled by evaporation as it circulates through the tower and is exposed to the atmosphere. Closed-Circuit Cooling Towers, on the other hand, use a separate fluid loop to transfer heat from the process fluid to the cooling tower. The closed-loop system minimizes water consumption and contamination while offering more control over the cooling process.</p></p>
