<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anular Closure Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Suturing System</li><li>Surgical Mesh</li><li>Reherniation Reduction Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anular closure devices are used in spinal surgeries to prevent reherniation and improve patient outcomes. There are three main types of anular closure devices on the market: suturing systems, surgical mesh, and reherniation reduction devices. Suturing systems involve stitching the annulus fibrosus closed after a discectomy. Surgical mesh is implanted to reinforce the annulus and reduce the risk of reherniation. Reherniation reduction devices use various mechanisms to support the disc and prevent further herniation. Each type of device aims to improve the success of spinal surgeries and reduce the need for repeat procedures.</p></p>
