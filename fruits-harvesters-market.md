<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fruits Harvesters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Towed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fruit harvesters come in two main market types: self-propelled and towed. Self-propelled harvesters are machines equipped with their own engine and can move independently across the orchard. They offer greater flexibility and maneuverability, making them ideal for larger operations. Towed harvesters, on the other hand, are pulled by a tractor or other vehicle and are better suited for smaller orchards or those with more limited budgets. Both types of harvesters play a crucial role in efficiently gathering fruits during harvest season.</p></p>
