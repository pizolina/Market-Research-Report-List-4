<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Liquefaction Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Exchanger</li><li>Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LNG liquefaction equipment market can be divided into two main types: heat exchangers and compressors. Heat exchangers are used to cool natural gas into liquid form by exchanging heat with a refrigerant. Compressors, on the other hand, are used to increase the pressure of the natural gas before it is cooled. Both types of equipment are essential in the process of converting natural gas into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transportation and storage.</p></p>
